To start up any of these projects you will need to put it in a folder AndroidStudio can access like the Documents folder
then using AndroidStudio open it up.

Not every project works flawlessly, I think there were one or two that required upgraded firebase to complete
I did not fully complete those ones, I did all of the frontend coding but I did not test with firebase, (obviously I could not without giving my credit card number to Firebase)
Also the last project I completed the chatRoomApplication did not include functionality to add new rooms, I downloaded the sourcecode to make sure and their code did not work either
